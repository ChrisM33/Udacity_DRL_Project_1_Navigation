This means for instance that the user can start this notebook, run the code cells \"load libraries\", \"create environment\", \"create agent instance\" and then the user can run the testing code in the end of the notebook.

This solution implementation evaluated more DQN NN models, which can be selected in the file **dqn_agent.py** by uncommenting the desired model and commenting the other models in the beginning of the file **dqn_agent.py**.
